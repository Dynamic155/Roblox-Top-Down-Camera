# Roblox-Top-Down-Camera
A simple top-down camera that I made in Roblox studio for a game I might work on.

## How to use:
- Add a LocalScript to StarterPlayer --> StarterPlayerScripts
- Paste in the script
- Edit the config

```lua
-- This is how high above the character the camera is. (In Studs)
local cameraHeight = 25

-- This is the camerasOffset X & Z positions, for example if you want the camera to be more to the left, right, top or bottom of the character.
-- You can even add to the script to make the camera follow the orientation of the player. 
local cameraOffsetX = 0
local cameraOffsetZ = 0
```
